This is a part of Cool R Things series made purely for educational purposes. Contains both .rmd file and the notebook.

In this series i demonstrate various things that R allows us to do from web scraping, building dashboards, creating maps and many more.

We explore the creation of interactive maps using the ```leaflet``` library in R in this project. With leaflet, i demonstrate the generation of maps enriched with markers, popups, and other engaging features. Our focus lies in creating a visually appealing map of the United States, adorned with markers highlighting key cities of significance.
